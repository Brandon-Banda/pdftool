Implementation:

```python3 pdftool.py```

Upon execution the script checks for folder existence in Documents and opens it's downloads folder. The user then moves desired PDFs into the opened folder. 

Executing the script will rename the files accordingly, and remove the pages necessary to format the PDFs as desired, as well as open the directory to which the files were moved to for archive.
